    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">We’ve included annotations in the gray boxes below to emphasize certain portions of our notice and help guide you as you read them. The annotations aren’t summaries, so please take the time to read everything!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">This describes the general terms that apply to your use of any of our services. By using our services you agree to these terms on top of any other terms that apply to a specific service you are using. If you use our services on behalf of your company, your company agrees to them too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">These General Terms of Service (“General Terms”) are a legal agreement between you, as a current or prospective customer of qydo’s services (“you,” “your”) and Katana Limited (”qydo,” “we,” “our” or “us”) and govern your use of qydo’s services, including mobile applications, websites, software, cloud-based solutions, hardware, and other products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and application programming interfaces that may be used to access the Services. By using any of the Services, you agree to these General Terms and any policies referenced within (“Policies”), including our Privacy Notice (see Section 8) and terms that limit our liability (see Section 18) and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see Section 21), which are collectively incorporated herein by reference. You also agree to any additional terms specific to Services you use (“Additional Terms”), such as those listed below, which become part of your agreement with us (collectively, the “Terms”). If you are using the Services on behalf of a business, you represent to us that you have authority to bind that business or entity to these Terms, and that business accepts these Terms. You should read all of our Terms carefully.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">You must open an account with us (a “qydo Account”) to use the Services. During registration we will ask you for information, which may include but is not limited to, your name and other personal information. You must provide accurate and complete information in response to our questions, and you must keep that information current. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your qydo Account, including for any actions taken by persons to whom you have granted access to the qydo Account. We reserve the right to change the account type, suspend or terminate the qydo Account of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or who fails to comply with the account registration requirements. We will provide you with support to resolve general issues relating to your qydo Account and your use of the Services.

The Revised Version will be effective as of the time it is posted, but will not apply retroactively. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of a Revised Version constitutes your acceptance of such Revised Version.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">7. Security</span></p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">We take security incredibly seriously, but can’t guarantee that bad actors will not gain access to your personal information. You need to do your part by keeping your passwords safe, being smart about who has access to your account and which of your devices can access our services, and letting us know if you think an unauthorized person is using your account.If there is ever a dispute about who owns your account, we are the decider.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental destruction, loss, alteration and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You provide your personal information at your own risk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">You are solely responsible for safeguarding your password and for restricting access to the Services from your compatible mobile devices and computer(s). You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or qydo Account or any other breach of security. You will immediately take all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of a security breach and will cooperate with qydo and provide all information requested by qydo to remediate the breach. Any assistance provided by qydo in relation to a security breach does not in any way operate as acceptance or acknowledgement that qydo is in any way responsible or liable to you or any other party in connection with such breach.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Notwithstanding Sections 20 and 21, in the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account ownership, we will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion. Our decision (which may include termination or suspension of any qydo Account subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all parties.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">8. Privacy</span></p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">By using any of our Services as a qydo seller, you acknowledge our data practices that apply to you, as set out in the qydo Account Holder Privacy Notice (the “Privacy Notice”). The Privacy Notice explains how qydo collects, uses and protects the personal information you provide to us where qydo makes use of your personal data to provide you with the Services or for its own purposes. You are required to familiarize yourself with the Privacy Notice prior to using the Services. If you or your business are located in California, please see Section 27.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">9. Communications</span></p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">You consent to us sending messages to your email or mobile devices about your account or our services, which may include marketing. You can opt out of communications in ways that are specific to that communication method, such as by unsubscribing from emails, or replying to text messages with ‘STOP’.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">You consent to accept and receive communications from us, including e-mail, text messages, calls, and push notifications to the cellular telephone number you provide to us when you sign-up for a qydo account or update the contact information associated with your account. Such communications may include, but are not limited to requests for secondary authentication, receipts, reminders, notifications regarding updates to your account or account support, and marketing or promotional communications. You acknowledge that you are not required to consent to receive promotional texts or calls as a condition of using the Services. Call and text message communications may be generated by automatic telephone dialing systems. Standard message and data rates applied by your cell phone carrier may apply to the text messages we send you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">You may opt-out of receiving promotional email communications we send to you by following the unsubscribe options on such emails. You may opt out of any promotional phone calls by informing the caller that you would not like to receive future promotional calls. You may only opt-out of text messages from qydo by replying STOP. You acknowledge that opting out of receiving communications may impact your use of the Services.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">We also provide Services that allow you to send short message service (SMS) messages to your customers (the “Seller-Initiated SMS Services”). You will only use the Seller-Initiated SMS Services in compliance with these Terms and all other applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdiction from which you send messages and in which your messages are received.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">10. Paid Services</span></p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">Lots of what we offer is free, but we offer paid services too. We can collect payments for a paid service by either charging your linked debit/credit card or taking the payment from your transaction proceeds, qydo-account balance or linked bank account.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">We’ll give you 30 days advance notice if we change our subscription fees, and you can cancel your subscription at any time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">qydo’s Services include both paid-for Services (“Paid Services”) and free Services, for which no fees are charged (“Free Services”). qydo offers certain Paid Services to be paid for on a recurring basis (“Subscription Services”) and others on an as-used basis (collectively, “Paid Services Fees”). Subscription Services may subject you to recurring fees and/or terms. By signing up for a Subscription Service, including after any free trial period, you agree to pay us the subscription fee and any applicable taxes (“Subscription Fee”). See qydo's Business Account and Mastercard Terms for terms applicable to Payment Services.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Paid Service Fees may be paid by debit card, credit card, or deducted from your transaction proceeds; however, Paid Service Fees related to hardware may only be paid by debit card or credit card. If you link a debit or credit card to your account, you authorize us to collect Paid Service Fees by debit from your linked debit card or charge to your linked credit card. Regardless of payment device, we reserve the right to collect Paid Service Fees by deduction from your transaction proceeds, the balance in your qydo Account or your linked bank account.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">Unless otherwise provided in a Subscription Service’s terms, Subscription Fees will be charged on the first of every month until cancelled. You may cancel a Subscription Service at any time from your qydo Account settings. If you cancel a Subscription Service, you will continue to have access to that Subscription Service through the end of your then current billing period, but you will not be entitled to a refund or credit for any Subscription Fee already due or paid. We reserve the right to change our Subscription Fee upon thirty (30) days’ advance notice. Your continued use of Subscription Services after notice of a change to our Subscription Fee will constitute your agreement to such changes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">You are responsible for all applicable taxes that arise from or as a result of your use of qydo’s Services. For the avoidance of doubt, all sums payable by you to qydo under the Terms shall be paid free and clear of any deductions or withholdings whatsoever. Other than taxes that may be charged by qydo to you and remitted to the appropriate tax authorities on your behalf, any deductions or withholdings that are required by law shall be borne by you and paid separately to the relevant taxation authority.</span>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">When you see the word “Dispute” in these terms, here’s what it means.</span></p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0">“Disputes” are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and qydo, its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees), whether arising before or during the effective period of these Terms, and including any claim, controversy, or dispute based on any conduct of you or qydo that occurred before the effective date of these Terms, including any claims relating in any way to these Terms or the Services, or any other aspect of our relationship.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">21. Binding Individual Arbitration</span></p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0">This section provides details about how we will resolve disputes through the arbitration process</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">General.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You and qydo agree that any and all Disputes, except those that are resolved informally, will be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST qydo. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Pre-Filing Requirement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Before an arbitration is commenced, you or qydo agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a Dispute informally. Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms. To provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice (“Notice”). Any Notice to qydo should be sent by mail to Katana Limited, Attn: Arbitration Provision, Unit 1603, 16th Floor, The L. Plaza, 367 - 375 Queen's Road Central, Sheung Wan, Hong Kong. Any Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account. The Notice must: (i) include your name and account number; (ii) provide detailed information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming party’s individualized claim and for the other party to determine if an amicable resolution is possible; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before, either party may commence arbitration. Each party agrees that state courts in Hong Kong SAR, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Scope of Arbitration. </span><span class="c0">If we are not able to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by the American Arbitration Association according to this Section and the Commercial Arbitration Rules for that forum, except you and qydo will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and to request that the AAA’s Expedited Procedures apply regardless of the claim amount. Except as set forth above, the Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the General Terms and/or Additional Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Arbitration Procedures. </span><span class="c0">Any arbitration hearing will occur in Hong Kong, at another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or videoconference. The Arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. qydo values your privacy, particularly with respect to your financial transactions and data. Each of the parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party) disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other result of the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable law. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s claim. The Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Arbitration Fees. </span><span class="c0">In accordance with the AAA Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or us) is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and qydo also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c6">Opt Out. </span><span class="c0">You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any Dispute. To reject this provision, you must send us an opt-out notice (the “Opt Out”) within thirty (30) days after you create a qydo account or we first provide you with the right to reject this provision. The Opt Out must be mailed to Katana Limited, Attn: Arbitration Provision, Unit 1603, 16th Floor, The L. Plaza, 367 - 375 Queen's Road Central, Sheung Wan, Hong Kong. You must complete this form by providing your name, address, phone number and the email address(es) you used to sign up and use the Services. This is the only way of opting out of this provision. Opting out will not affect any other aspect of the General Terms, Additional Terms, or the Services, and will have no effect on any other or future agreements you may reach to arbitrate with us.</span>

      <span class="c6">Court Proceedings. </span><span class="c0">Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in Hong Kong SAR.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">22. Governing Law</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Our relationship is governed by the laws of Hong Kong SAR.</span></p>
